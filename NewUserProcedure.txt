AUTHENTICATION and USER Class

I am currently thinking about how to manage each NEW User:

> In the signUp method I create a new entry in the FireBase Authentication Database
> This is separate to our database structure

THEN

> Take the unique id generated by FireBase:
>> Create a new User()
>> newUser.setId = the unique id
>> newUser.setEmail = email just used
>> add newUser to Database

> Pass newUser into MainActivity using Intent

> In the main activity

>> Maybe in the profile fragment the use can fill-in/edit their other info

I still need to implement the database management

NOTE:
> When MainActivity is Created:
>> We always retrieve the currentUser from the Intent when signed in
>> Retrieve currentUser info from Database
>> Set up the Profile Fragment based on the retrieved data
